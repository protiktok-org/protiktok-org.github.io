                    TikTok is a popular social media app that originated in China, originally called Musicly, currently <br />
                    owned by ByteDance. It is a major social media for short form videos and popular among lots of <br />
                    teenagers. Over the past three years as of the time of writing this (early 2024), there have been some <br />
                    attempts to ban the app for national security and "protecting the children". This website lists some <br />
                    reasons it shouldn't be banned, and mainly focuses on the <br />
                    <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&r=1" target="_blank">
                        Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act
                    </a> bill.

                <h2>Why we shouldn't ban TikTok:</h2>
                <h3>1. Free speech</h3>
                <p>
                    Banning TikTok threatens free speech because millions of people use it to spread messages and communicate, <br />
                    it also tries to restrict what apps / programs you can publish online, which should be none of the governments business.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>2. Rights to your device</h3>
                <p>
                    The government should have no business telling you what apps / programs you can install on your own personal devices. <br />
                    The government shouldn't baby its citizens and tell them what they can or cannot install on their devices, TikTok is <br />
                    not forced upon the user, it is your choice to download and use it.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>3. Implementation / enforcement</h3>
                <p>
                    The implementation of this ban could be detrimental to free speech and privacy if not implemented correctly, for example, <br />
                    would they heavily increase surveillance online to try to stop people from distributing it? Would they increase the power of <br />
                    the FCC and give them the power to easily censor whatever website they want for this purpose? Currently, the proposed bill <br />
                    wouldn't legally allow them to do this, but if it is easy to get around, new bills could be proposed to implement some of <br />
                    these things, and that also opens the door to lots of abuse of power.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>4. Malicious intent</h3>
                <p>
                    This bill to ban TikTok might not really be for "national security" or "protecting the children", but rather a way to <br />
                    normalize this kind of government control, or give them more power and control over the internet with its implementation. <br />
                    It could also be used for increasing users in other American social media services such as Facebook or Twitter, <br />
                    simply so some big tech corporations can profit and collect more user data. There have been many bills trying to give <br />
                    the government more control over the internet such as
                    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102164747/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.03261:" target="_blank">SOPA</a>
                    (stop online piracy act) and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409" target="_blank">KOSA</a>
                    (kids online safety act), <br />
                    these bills are designed to heavily increase digital surveillance and censorship, it is not unusual for bills like this to be proposed.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>5. Loss of careers</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people enjoy using TikTok and some people make a living off of it, so it would be kinda unethical to ban it.
